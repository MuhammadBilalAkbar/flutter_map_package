**Great Features**

- flutter_map package is versatile, simple, easy, customizable and configurable.
- Find more features at [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map).

**Problems from Videos**

- Question: How can we get our location automatically without describing lat or long?

Answer: You need to add a geolocator in your app so it gets your location automatically when you
open your app and add it directly to the map.

- Question: How to use the animation camera in the flutter map that is in the google map?

Answer: You need to create a Map controller and adding it to the map. Then using the controller you
can animate the camera to move around.
